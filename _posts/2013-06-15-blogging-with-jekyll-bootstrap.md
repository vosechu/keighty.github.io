Building a portfolio has been a lot of fun and has required a couple of
different technologies. A fellow PCS student has been blogging a long time,
and he suggested using Jekyll in combination with github pages. What a
fantastic gem! I found an even more awesome one at [jekyll-bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).

Now I am enjoying the power of bootstrap along with the ease of jekyll.

To create a post
{% highlight ruby %}
$ rake post title="Hello World"
{% endhighlight %}

To create a new page:
{% highlight ruby %}
$ rake page name="pages/about"
{% endhighlight %}

Couldn't be simpler for a beginning blogger.
