Welcome to my resume! I am at a transition point in my career and
looking for a change. I never suspected that I would develop a
passion for writing beautiful code -- my educational background is
on another spectrum, in biology and literature. Computers remained
a mystery to me until a few years ago when I was asked by my boss
to become an expert in our newly acquired electronic document
management system. You could say that HTML had me at "Hello World".
I will always remember the thrill I had when I rendered that line,
because I experience it anew every time I write a piece of
functional code. Coding is applied creativity! I am amazed that I
have finally found my passion, and excited to be sharing it with you.
