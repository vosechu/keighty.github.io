##Don't Eat That!

"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it." -- Oscar Wilde

Cheating on your diet is essential to success! With
all the culinary temptations we encounter everyday, it is impossible
to deny our cravings all of the time. The key is to eat healthy most of
the time and allow yourself occasional guilt-free cheating.

Don't Eat That! is an application that can help you decide when to say
"No" to those donuts or cupcakes, and when to go ahead and indulge. We
call it "structured splurging." Behind one of those doors is
the permission to cheat, and you get three chances to find it!

##Trash Your Troubles

<!-- [Trash Your Troubles Logo]({{ ASSET_PATH }}/images/mail.png) -->

Trash Your Troubles will helps lessen the impact of negative thoughts
by letting you throw them away.

We throw garbage away all of the time. If we didn’t, it would build up
in our kitchens, bathrooms, offices… and eventually take over our homes
entirely. Negative thoughts are mental garbage. They affect our daily
activities, our emotions, and our relationships. If we allow them to,
negative thoughts can build up until they take over our minds.

It doesn’t have to be this way. A series of experiments in the journal
Psychological Science, subjects wrote positive or negative thoughts on
a piece of paper or into a text document on a computer.
They then either kept their thoughts or
threw them away (into the trash can or the computer’s recycle bin). In
later assessments, subjects who had thrown their thoughts away were less
affected by them than subjects who had held onto their thoughts. In
other words, subjects who treated their thoughts as trash were no longer
influenced by them.
